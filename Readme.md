This is a full-stack web created with mern-stack(Mongodb,Express,React,Node.Js).If users are logged in they can create places,write comments in other users' places,likes places and rate places.You will be notified if other users did any of these things on your places.You will be able to edit the places you created but not other users' places.File upload is currently not available but you can upload the images by putting the image link.Error messages will not be displayed either.It took me over a month to create this.Hopefully this will make a good portfolio.
