This website is for place sharing.It has users log in functionalities and authorization.You can create place,if you are authorized,if you own the place you can delete it,you can 
edit it.You can like and write comments on other users' places if you are logged in.You can also rate other users' places.This is built with MERN_Stack and it literally took me
almost a moth to create this.There are some things that I still need to add,like file upload and error message displaying.I will be working on these things in the future.This is
the biggest and longest web app I have ever created so far.I hope this will make a good portfolio.

Thanks.
